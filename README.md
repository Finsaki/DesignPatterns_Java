# DesignPatterns_Java
In this repository I will post my self made Java design patterns for university design patterns course
The project was originally located in SVN but decided to move it here when some problems with SVN came up

Design patterns in this project:
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Composite
- Observer
- Singleton
- Decorator
- State
- Template Method
- Strategy
- Chain of Responsibility
- Memento
- Proxy
- Visitor
- Builder
- Adapter
- Bridge (Only pdf)
- Flyweight (+ pdf)
- Prototype
- Mediator (Only jpg)
- Iterator (+ pdf)
- Facade
- Command

Most design patterns contain only the code used, some also have pdf explaining the functionality.
Mediator is only described by a jpg picture.
